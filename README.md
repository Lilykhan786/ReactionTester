## Hacktober Fest
> It is the best time to start learning about open source. This year in Oct 2020, you have to make 4 valid PR's in Public repositories, to be a part and succesfully completing the same.
NOT TO FORGET, you will get super cool swags by doing so, which includes a Tshirt and stickers, or you can instead choose to plant a tree on successfully making 4 PRs. Isn't that so exciting? :heart_eyes: 

Don't forget to register at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com , link your github account with it and start contributing from 1st Oct!
